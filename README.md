# StarControl2
Building a model that would help you decide which planet to survey, while playing StarControl-II.
Is it the yellow star next to the red giant?
Or perhaps the orange one, further away from the huge green sun? :)

"Why do you do this thing?"

You have spoken the Words, and you have spoken them rightly.
Maybe like me, you replay StarControl-II from time to time, and maybe, also like me, you are loath to use guides that would tell you in advance where the best worlds are. Exactly where.

It ruins half of the fun, doesn't it?

So what, if you could make educated guesses, which stars would be better to approach, instead of just guessing?
The fun part of exploration would remain!

So I'll be making here a model (and post its results), using the planetary data, to make guesses which worlds are best to visit (orange, close to the sun, or maybe, yellow that are farther away from it?). You can then use the decision tree to decide how it would be best to explore any star system, and maximize your RUs and Biologicals!

Have fun!
